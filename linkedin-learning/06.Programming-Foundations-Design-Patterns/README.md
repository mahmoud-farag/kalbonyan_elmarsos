# 😎😎Section Notes

## 🧐01. Design patterns:

==>🤩 its just reusing experience and pre defined solutions and algorithms
==>🤩 general solutions for a common problems.

### Object-oriented design essentials

- 🐱‍🏍Inheritance.
- 🐱‍🏍polymorphism.
- 🐱‍🏍abstraction.
- 🐱‍🏍encapsulation.

### benefits:

- 🐱‍🏍code reusability.
- 🐱‍🏍building resilient code.
- 🐱‍🏍preparing for future adding.

## 🧐02. The strategy pattern:

- 🐱‍🏍inheritance problems?
  - subclasses must inherit all super class feature (even un wanted ones )
- 🐱‍🏍interfaces problems?
  - it destroy code reusability principles.
- 🐱‍🏍Has-a{composition} better than Is-a{inheritance}?

  - classes should achieve code reuse using composition rather than inheritance form a superclass.

  caution==>🤩 in some cases composition is better than inheritance form making your code reusable.

## 🧐03. The adapter pattern:

==>🤩 a glue code/ interface which used to adapt two different classes/interfaces without chaning it.
==>🤩 this pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. it allows classes to work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## 🧐04. The Observer pattern:

==>🤩 loosely coupled {have little knowledge about each other} patterns which means that a two classes interact with each other without any direct dependency which also means if you remove a class form the sys, it still working fine !

==>🤩 it defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

## 🧐05. The Decorator pattern:

### the Open-closed Principle:

==>🤩 classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- 🐱‍🏍inheritance drawbacks:
  - powerful, but it can lead to inflexible designs.
  - all classes inherit the same behavior.
- 🐱‍🏍composition advatanges:
  - we can still inherit behavior.
  - we can make dynamic runtime decisions.
  - we can add new behavior without altering existing code.
  - we can include behaviors not considered by the creator.

## 🧐06. The Iterator pattern:

==>🤩 provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underline representation.

- 🐱‍🏍how to iterate over an aggregate Object:
  - ask object for its iterator.
  - use the iterator to iterate through the items in the aggregate.
  - iteration code now works with any kind of aggregate object

* 🐱‍🏍single responsibility principle
  ==🤩> the class should have only one reason to change.

## 🧐07. The Factory pattern:

==>🤩 its defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
