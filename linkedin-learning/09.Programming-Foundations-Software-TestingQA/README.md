# 😎😎 Section Notes

### 🙄 QA Quality-Assurance?

==>🤩 a systematic process used to determine wether a product meets specifications or not.

## 🧐 01. The Role of QA:

### 🙄 roles of responsibilities?

- 🐱‍🏍technical aptitude?
  - manual testing.
  - automated testing.
  - programming.
  - scripting.
- 🐱‍🏍business knowledge?
  - feature scoping.
  - test planning.
  - test-case management.
  - bug management.
- 🐱‍🏍devops principles?
  - configure tools.
  - set up ci.
  - set up test environments.
  - automate processes.
- 🐱‍🏍process and release expertise.
  - define and improve testing practices.
  - optimize release process.

### 🙄 SDLC process?

plan==>define==>design==>build==>test==>deploy {applied in leaner way}

- 🐱‍🏍plan?
  - identify risks.
  - identify use-cases.
- 🐱‍🏍define?
  - write specifications and acceptance criteria.
  - decide what is in scope.
  - write test strategy.
- 🐱‍🏍design && build?
  - solidify test scenarios.
  - get feedback on scenarios from team
  - manual and automation tests.
- 🐱‍🏍test?
  - acceptance testing.
- 🐱‍🏍deploy?
  - validate functionality.
  - release.
  - test in production.

### 🙄 set expectation and gaols?

- 🐱‍🏍build a relationship with your teammates and sharing knowledge.
- know the responsibilities of each role.
- 🐱‍🏍collaborate.

## 🧐 02. Test Planning:

### you have to create a test strategy/plan

### 🙄 acceptance criteria?

==>🤩 conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a stakeholder

## 🧐 03. Types of Testing QA Focuses On:

### 🙄 testing types?

- 🐱‍🏍Box testing?
  _ Black box?
  manual/UI-automation/performance testing.
  _ Gray box?
  integration testing/trigger some action in UI \* White box?
  focus in internal features like unit/system testing.

- 🐱‍🏍Manual testing?
  ==>🤩 before testing you have to identify both typical and nontypical use cases.
- 🐱‍🏍UI-automation testing.
  ==>🤩 scenarios can be executed repeatedly and catch regressions introduced in the application.
- 🐱‍🏍Integration testing.
  ==>🤩 how app features/components interact with each other.

- 🐱‍🏍performance testing?
  ==>🤩 how a system performs under load/ to make sure and application runs fast and well.
- 🐱‍🏍Security testing.
  ==>🤩 exposes problems in the app that cause unexpected behavior crashes.

### 🙄 load testing?

    ==> checks the application's ability to perform under user loads.

### 🙄 endurance testing?

    ==>🤩 check how an application handles load over time/its goal to check for system problems.

### 🙄 stress testing?

    ==>🤩 involves testing an app under extreme workloads. it is used for testing scalability/its goal to identify app break-points && software stability{when it fail && hwo to recover}.

### 🙄 sql injection?

    ==>🤩 used to insert DB statements into text fields and expose app info.

### 🙄 DOS {Denial-Of-Service}?

    ==> is an attack where hackers try to take down an app servers or network.

### 🙄 vulnerabilities?

==>🤩 in dependencies can cause massive security

## 🧐 04. Bug Reporting:

==>🤩 incorrect / unexpected behavior

### 🙄 bug reporting systems tools?

    jira/github/bugzilla

### 🙄 severity?

==>🤩 how impactful the bug is to the business.

### 🙄 priority?

==>🤩 how fast the bug should be fixed.
