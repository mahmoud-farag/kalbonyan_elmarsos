## 🧐01. Understanding Web Services:

==> way to make web services to talk to each others

### 🙄XML?

==>🤩 data communicate format between two nodes.

### 🙄web services advantages?

- 🐱‍🏍code reusability.
- 🐱‍🏍language transparency.
- 🐱‍🏍deployability
- 🐱‍🏍usability.

### 🙄latency?

==>🤩 the time a request take to return a response.

### 🙄partial failure?

==>🤩 when a server or network fails to respond.

### 🙄secure web services?

- 🐱‍🏍authentication {like http protocol}:
  ==>🤩 validates identity of client {who access the resource}

* 🐱‍🏍authorization:
  ==>🤩 determines level of clients access {does client can access or not a resource }

### all web services are APIs but not all APIs are web services.

### in descending order from more complex to more flat

- 🐱‍🏍web services.
- 🐱‍🏍micro-services.
- 🐱‍🏍APIs.

## 🧐02. Using RESTful APIs and HATEOAS:

==>🤩 a way to send/recive requests among client/server.

### 🙄API principles?

- 🐱‍🏍URI.
- 🐱‍🏍operations?
  _ post {create a resource}.
  _ get {retrieve a resource}.
  _ delete { remove a resource}.
  _ update {update a resource}.
- 🐱‍🏍formats?
  _ html.
  _ xml. \* plain-text.
- 🐱‍🏍stateless?
  ==>🤩 server will not store any state the client made.

### 🙄payload?

    ==> data sent between client and server.

### 🙄HATEOAS?

==>🤩 client interacts with a REST API entirely through the responses by the server.
==>🤩 resources should be discoverable through the publication of links.

- 🐱‍🏍postman?
  ==>🤩 a software app used to test and consume web-services && APIs.

* 🐱‍🏍Swagger?
  ==>🤩 a documentation tool for APIs to understand how they works

## 🧐03. Using SOAP-Based {Simple-Object-Access-Protocol}Web Services {alternative for REStful}:

==>🤩 it provide a more complexity and more security compared to REStful.

### 🙄WSDLdocs {Web-Service-Description-Language}?

==>🤩 a service telling the client of all the operations that can performed by the web-service
==>🤩 contains information, like the data types being used in SOAP messages, and operations available via the web-service

### 🙄SOAP benefits?

- 🐱‍🏍used fot enterprise-level web services {like paypal}.
- 🐱‍🏍financial services.
- 🐱‍🏍payment gateway.
- 🐱‍🏍CRM software.
- 🐱‍🏍identity management.
- 🐱‍🏍telecommunication services.

### 🙄web-services applying methods?

- 🐱‍🏍Restful.
- 🐱‍🏍SOAP.
- 🐱‍🏍graphql.

### 🙄soapUI?

a software tool used to test SOAP-based web-services

## 🧐04. Developing APIs Using GraphQL:

==>🤩 its a query language for APIs
==>🤩 a syntax describing how to ask for data, which is usually used to load data based on queries.
==>🤩 a way to aggregate data from multiple resources

### 🙄mutation?

==>🤩 modifies server-side data.

### 🙄subscription?

==>🤩 notifies changes in data in real time.
