# 😎😎Section Notes

## 👻types of data structures:

- 🐱‍🏍arrays.
- 🐱‍🏍linked-lists.
- 🐱‍🏍queues.
- 🐱‍🏍stacks.
- 🐱‍🏍hash maps.

## 🧐01.Introduction to data structure:

- 🐱‍🏍data is the information that stored or processed by a computer.

### 👻data types:

- 🐱‍🏍numbers: {whole:{short/int/long},decimal{float/double}}.
- 🐱‍🏍Boolean{true/false}.
- 🐱‍🏍Strings.

Note: primitive VS reference data types

## 🧐02.Arrays:

- 🐱‍🏍the array is a collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key.
- 🐱‍🏍indexes begins from zero.
- 🐱‍🏍you can create multidimensional array.

* 🐱‍🏍jagged array which can have elements of different dimensions and sizes.
* 🐱‍🏍array saved in a predefined memory area.

- 🐱‍🏍arrays in some languages sizable like{javascript, python} and in others is not like {java, c++}.

* 🐱‍🏍Big o Notation==>🤩 a Notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
* 🐱‍🏍O(1) Time ==>🤩 a constant time.

### big O of {insertion, deletion, searching, sorting}

- 🐱‍🏍insertion==>🤩 best-case:O(1), worst-case: O(n).
- 🐱‍🏍deletion==>🤩 best-case:O(1) , worst-case:O(n)
- 🐱‍🏍searching==>🤩 best-case:O(1) , worst-case:O(n)
- 🐱‍🏍sorting==>🤩 depends on sorting algorithm {insertion, merge,heap, bubble, bucket, radix }

## 🧐03.Linked-lists:

==> in lists the elements are liked using a pointers

- 🐱‍🏍insertion==>🤩 best-case:O(1), worst-case: O(1).
- 🐱‍🏍lists stored randomly in memory.

### linked list operations:

- 🐱‍🏍insertion==>🤩 best-case:O(1), worst-case: O(1).

* 🐱‍🏍access==>🤩 best-case:O(1), worst-case: O(n).
* 🐱‍🏍deletion==>🤩 best-case:O(1) , worst-case:O(n)
* 🐱‍🏍searching==>🤩 best-case:O(1) , worst-case:O(n)

## 04. Stacks && queues:

- 🐱‍🏍stack ==>🤩 last-in-first-out.
  - pors:
    - Reversing things.
    - keeping track of state.
    - add/remove from back of a structure.

* 🐱‍🏍queue ==> first-in-last-out.
  - Enqueue: adding item to a list.
  - Dequeue: removing item from a list.
  * see the first item in the list without removing it.

## 🧐05.Hash based:

a 🐱‍🏍Collection of key/value pairs

- 🐱‍🏍Hashing
  ==>🤩 data conversion process.

* 🐱‍🏍hashing done in one way.
* 🐱‍🏍Collisio
  n==>🤩 when two inputs produce the same hash value || when a two keys have the same hash value.
* 🐱‍🏍decrypt is two way.
* 🐱‍🏍hash map operations always take the same amount of time, regardless of the size of the hash table.

## 🧐06. Trees && Graphs:

- 🐱‍🏍Set:
  - A collection of unique items.
  - order does not matter.
  - none of the elements are duplicated.

* 🐱‍🏍binary tree==>🤩 a tree which have only two children.
* 🐱‍🏍Heap==>🤩 a data structure implemented as binary tree.
* 🐱‍🏍binary tree Big O ==>🤩 balanced:O(log(n)), unbalanced: O(n)
